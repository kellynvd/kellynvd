### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Hi, I'm Kellyn, a software developer, curious, connected, multidisciplinary, worried about my impact on the world and always looking to improve.

My professional journey began in Pedagogy, where I learned the importance of education and continuous improvement. In 2015, I embraced the world of technology and have never looked back. My goal is to build technology with purpose. I'm looking for challenging opportunities where I can positively impact the world, whether it's leading products or coding complex solutions. ðŸ’“

 Professional Career:

 **Product Management**: I started my tech career as a Product Manager, immersing myself in strategy, interdisciplinary collaboration and building products that make a difference.

 **Front-End**: In search of more knowledge, I went deeper into front-end development, transforming designs into engaging and intuitive experiences.

 **Full Stack Developer**: I'm currently making my way as a Full Stack Developer, integrating technologies to create robust and innovative solutions.

So far my skills include:
