### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Kellyn, a developer and a classic millennial: curious, connected, multidisciplinary, worried about my impact on the world, always wanting more and better and who drinks a lot of coffee. â˜•

I have a strong desire to always be learning and my professional career is a reflex of this. I graduated in Pedagogy and I used to work as a kindergarten teacher. But after some time - even though I still love to share knowledge - teaching started to not make sense anymore and I started looking for new challenges.

And that's when it happened, the missing spark âœ¨ came when I started working as a technical support in a software development company. If before I was not sure what path I would take, at that moment I knew it was in technology. 

Soon after that I started working as a Product Owner at a company that develops software for education and that's when I also learned more about product management, software quality, and even wrote some code occasionally. 

Since then I was fascinated by the idea of using software to solve practical problems and I found out that programming includes all my passions: creativity, organization, attention to detail and it is a never ending puzzle that I love to solve. 

So I decided to focus on building my career as a software developer and so far my skills include:

Besides this I have learned how to have the discipline not to give up when things get complicated (and of course I have learned how to test my own code). Certainly I still have a lot more to learn, a lot more problems to solve, a lot more to develop and this is what makes me love coding.ðŸ’“
